## How to use

The best way is to install the mod [Schematic Browser](https://github.com/MindustryDesignIt/schematic-browser-mod), which lets you insert schematics from GitHub repositories. Schematic Browser can be installed in Mindustry using the built-in mod browser. In the “Schematic Repositories” view, click on “Add Repo” and type “holmes-g/erekir-schematics”, confirm with “Add Repo”, then click on “Fetch” to update schematics from configured repositories.
